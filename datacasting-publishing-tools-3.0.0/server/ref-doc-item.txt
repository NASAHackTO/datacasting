# Customelement: Custom elements allow you, the data provider, to add
# features to the Datacasting feed which are set for each item.  For
# example, you might want to publish the Percent Cloudiness in an image,
# or the Fraction of Bad Pixels.  You can also publish summary
# statistics for the data (Min, Max, Mean, Median, whatever makes
# sense).  The idea is to include information that will help your user
# decide if they want the granule.
#
# NOTE: Custom elements are defined in the feed config file and must be
# defined there to use them here...
